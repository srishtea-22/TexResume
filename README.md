# TexResume
TexResume is a web-based resume builder designed specifically for tech students and professionals. It allows users to create structured, professional LaTeX resumes by filling out a form. The LaTeX code is generated dynamically, and a real-time PDF preview is compiled using SwiftLaTeX in WebAssembly (WASM).
